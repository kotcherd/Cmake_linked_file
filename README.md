# Cmake_linked_file

===== to test:
source @go

=====START
I had issues building a library with CMake where some of the source files were links.  Here is a contrived example to re-create that situation... but it works! 

THing is...  the original situation has broken symlinks!



Anyhow, I think it is a useful fortran example.  It also has interdependent modules to experiment with proper compilation order.
